# Project 1 Question 5-c - Python
# Created by Ryan Doherty
# (c)	(5 points) (You must submit code for this question!) Use your iterative implementations of your AVL Tree and BST from Parts 1 and 2 to construct trees from the input of your implementation of getRandomArray(10,000). Both trees must be made from the same array. In other words, do not call the method twice - store the output of the method from getRandomArray(10,000) once and use it to construct both trees.
