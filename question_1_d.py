# Project 1 Question 1 part d code - Python
# Created by Ryan Doherty

# (8 points) (You must submit code for this question! ) Submit an implementation
# of the following iterative methods in a Binary Search Tree. You do not need to
# submit written answers to the framework from above, but it might be useful for
# you to consider the answers to those questions when writing code. Note that the
# Iter sux simply means that the function is iterative. Keep in mind that an
# iterative solution cannot make a single recursive call!
# 1. insertIter
# 2. deleteIter
# 3. findNextIter
# 4. findPrevIter
# 5. findMinIter
# 6. findMaxIter
